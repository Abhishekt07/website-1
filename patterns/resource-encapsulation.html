# Resource encapsulation

_“A resource and its lifecycle are responsibilities that must be owned by one component.”_

From the [Simple Component](simple-component.html) pattern, you know that every
component does only one thing, but does it in full; in other words, each
component is fully responsible for the functionality it provides to the rest of
the system. If we regard that functionality as a resource that is used by other
components—inside or outside the system—then it is clear that resource,
responsibility, and component exactly coincide. These three terms all denote
the same boundary: in this view, resource encapsulation and the single
responsibility principle are the same.  The same reasoning can be applied when
considering other resources, in particular those used to provide a component’s
function. These are not implemented but merely are managed or represented: the
essence of the Resource Encapsulation pattern is that you must identify that
component into whose responsibility each resource falls, and place it there.
The resource becomes part of that component’s responsibility. Sometimes this
will lead you to identify the management of an external resource as a notable
responsibility that needs to be broken out into its own simple component.
