# Error Kernel

_“In a supervision hierarchy, keep important application state or functionality near the root while delegating risky operations towards the leaves.”_

This pattern builds on the [Simple Component](./simple-component.html) pattern and is applicable wherever
components with different failure probability and reliability requirements are
combined into a larger system or application—some functions of the system must
never go down, whereas others are necessarily exposed to failure. Applying the
Simple Component pattern will frequently leave you in this position, so it pays
to familiarize yourself well with the Error Kernel pattern.

This pattern has been established in Erlang programs for decades and was one of
the main inspirations for Jonas Bonér to implement an Actor framework—Akka—on
the JVM. The name Akka was originally conceived as a palindrome of Actor
Kernel, referring to this core design pattern.
