<p><em>“Manage an explicit input queue, and react to its fill level.”</em></p>

<p>One of the conclusions drawn from analyzing the <a href="pull.html">Pull pattern</a> is that it can be
used to mediate back pressure across multiple processing steps in a chain of
components. Transmitting back pressure means halting the entire pipeline when
the a consumer is momentarily overwhelmed, which may, for example, be caused by
unfair scheduling or other execution artifacts, leading to avoidable
inefficiencies in the system.</p>

<p>This kind of friction can lead to “stuttering” behavior in a processing engine,
where short bursts of messages alternate with periods of inactivity during
which back-pressure signals travel through the system. These bursts can be
smoothed out by employing buffers that allow the data to keep flowing even
during short back-pressure situations. These buffers are queues that
temporarily hold messages while remembering their ordering. We call them
managed queues because their use extends beyond this direct benefit: queues can
be used to monitor and steer the performance of a messaging system. Buffering
and managed queues are even more important at the boundaries of a system that
employs back pressure: if data or requests are ingested from a source that
cannot be slowed down, you need to mediate between the bounded internal
capacity and the potentially unbounded influx.</p>
