# Managed queue

_“Manage an explicit input queue, and react to its fill level.”_

One of the conclusions drawn from analyzing the [Pull pattern](pull.html) is that it can be
used to mediate back pressure across multiple processing steps in a chain of
components. Transmitting back pressure means halting the entire pipeline when
the a consumer is momentarily overwhelmed, which may, for example, be caused by
unfair scheduling or other execution artifacts, leading to avoidable
inefficiencies in the system.

This kind of friction can lead to “stuttering” behavior in a processing engine,
where short bursts of messages alternate with periods of inactivity during
which back-pressure signals travel through the system. These bursts can be
smoothed out by employing buffers that allow the data to keep flowing even
during short back-pressure situations. These buffers are queues that
temporarily hold messages while remembering their ordering. We call them
managed queues because their use extends beyond this direct benefit: queues can
be used to monitor and steer the performance of a messaging system. Buffering
and managed queues are even more important at the boundaries of a system that
employs back pressure: if data or requests are ingested from a source that
cannot be slowed down, you need to mediate between the bounded internal
capacity and the potentially unbounded influx.
