# Multiple-master: Conflict detection and resolution

_“Keep multiple copies of a service running in different locations, accept modifications everywhere, and disseminate all modifications among them.”_

If you want to change your replication scheme such that it can continue to
operate during a transient network partition, then you will have to make some
compromises. Obviously, it is impossible to reach consensus without
communication, so if all cluster nodes are to make progress in accepting and
processing requests at all times, conflicting actions may be performed.
