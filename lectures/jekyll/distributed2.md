This lecture goes deeper on how the Akka Cluster works. In particular you will see:

* how the state of each cluster member is managed in an eventually-consistent fashion
* that the feature of lifecycle monitoring demands that the membership list of the cluster must be managed with some consistency

The effects are demonstrated on the link checker example as well.
