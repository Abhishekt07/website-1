In this lecture we build upon what we learned about an Actorâ€™s lifecycle and introduce facilities for monitoring it. We then discuss the consequences of hierarchical supervision for the architecture of our system. In particular we cover:

* that the only observable lifecycle transition is termination
* that the inability to communicate cannot be distinguished from failure
* how the DeathWatch API in Akka supports using these facts for writing resilient systems
* how failure affects child Actors and consequently that important state needs to be kept near the root of the hierarchy
* how logging works in Akka and how unhandled messages can be observed
