This lecture gives a more formal introduction to the Actor model. In particular we cover:

* some historical background
* first steps with the Akka implementation
* handling mutable state within an Actor
* sending and receiving messages
* creating and stopping Actors

The video concludes with a demonstration of running an Actor System and a summary of what Actors are according to the formal model.
