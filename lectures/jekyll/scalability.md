This lecture discusses scalability, starting out from contrasting this characteristic with performance—the goal that is often inadequately placed first. We cover:

* vertical and horizontal scalability by replicating Actors on a single host or on a cluster
* various routing strategies for distributing requests across the replicas
* how consistent hashing (or “sharding”) allows the replication of stateful Actors.
