This lecture sets the stage for the Akka Typed week: we explore how to express
a communication protocol such that a machine can understand the message
exchange — meaning who shall send which message type and when. In particular we
discuss session types, consisting of a global type that describes the whole
interaction at once, and local projections that specify the expected sequence
of send and receive operations for any single party in isolation.
